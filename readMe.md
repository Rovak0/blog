#Personal blog

## Description
It's a place to store my thoughts.  Saves those thoughts is local memory. 

## Usage
It's not too fancy, all you need to do is fill out the text boxes and submit the form.  Annoyingly, the only default way to get to the posts themselves requires you to submit a new blog post.  This can be avoided by going directly to the posts page (https://rovak0.github.io/blog/assets/html/blogPages.html).  Also, deleting posts isn't great; you will need to go into the console and delete the entire blog out of local memory.
